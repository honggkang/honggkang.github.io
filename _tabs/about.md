## Short bio
I received the B.Sc. degree in electronic engineering from Hanyang University, Seoul, South Korea, in 2017, and the M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees from the School of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejeon, South Korea, in 2019 and 2024. My research interests include signal processing, wireless communications, edge AI, and distributed machine learning.

## Motto

> I have worked on innumerable problems that you would call humble, but which I enjoyed and felt very good about because I sometimes could partially succeed... No problem is too small or too trivial if we can really do something about it. <br /> (Richard Feynman's Letter on What Problems to Solve)

> I have not failed, but found 1000 ways to not make a light bulb. <br />(Thomas Edison) 

- Every decision entails trade-offs. There is no option that is entirely negative or entirely positive. It is unnecessary to excessively ruminate over a decision and hesitate. Instead, act without hesitation!

- Everything gets unstable without feedback. Failure is tolerable, but without same mistakes. Learning from failure is necessary.

- My goal is not to fail in short period, but to succeed in long-term.

- Nobody lives in a complete and stable circumstances. I Just do my best in my position.

- Things I get while pursuing a goal is also my goal.

- I get tired but I am not painful. I don't get disappointed by failures.

- I live my own life. I am not conscious of the others.
